                        <p class="lead">Instagram is a powerful platform boasting impressive monthly traffic of over
                            870,000 visitors. It helps businesses in generating leads, creating brand awareness and
                            driving sales. However, with the rise of targeted ads and constant data collection, your
                            digital privacy is under constant threat of being compromised, and safeguarding your
                            personal information has never been more crucial. This updated guide allows you to take
                            power back into your hands and secure your <strong class="more-storng"> Instagram privacy
                                settings </strong> in 2025.</p>

                        <h2>How Instagram tracks You and Why It Matters</h2>

                        <p>From your location, your likes, your browsing experience, and even information about linked
                            accounts ‚Äî Instagram collects user data and this practice has changed significantly over
                            time. This information is not only used to show you personalized ads based on your
                            preferences but is also shared with third-party partners. While this data helps improve the
                            app‚Äôs services and offers a more tailored experience while scrolling, you can still choose
                            what to share by managing your privacy settings. You can always keep track of your digital
                            footprint once you have adjusted these privacy settings.</p>
                        <p class="more-storng"> Let‚Äôs jump right in: </p>
                        <h3> 1. Switch Your Account to Private</h3>
                        <p>One of the first steps in Instagram privacy settings is setting your account to private. This
                            will ensure that only approved followers can view your posts and stories, keeping unwanted
                            attention at bay.</p>
                        <h4>How to set your account to private:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Go to Settings > Privacy.</li>
                            <li>Toggle on the Private Account option.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <h3>2. Control Who Can Tag You</h3>
                        <p>Decide who can tag you in their posts, who can message you, and whether people can search for
                            you by your phone number or email address. Limiting this can prevent unwanted attention and
                            privacy breaches.</p>
                        <h4>To manage who can tag you:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Go to Settings > Tags > Who Can Tag You.</li>
                            <li>Select Everyone, People You Follow, or No One.</li>
                        </ul>




                        <h3>3. Restrict Who Can DM You</h3>
                        <p>Managing direct messages (DMs) is crucial in avoiding spam and unwanted interactions. Control
                            who can send you message requests to further protect your privacy.</p>
                        <h4>To adjust DM settings:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Go to Settings > Privacy > Messages.</li>
                            <li>Select who can send you message requests (e.g., Friends, Followers, or No One).</li>
                        </ul>


                        <h3>4. Hide Your Story</h3>
                        <p>Your stories. You can always hide your stories from certain people who want to keep tabs on
                            everything you‚Äôre up to (we all have those people). Moreover, you can restrict people from
                            sharing them with others and even choose your audience.</p>
                        <h4>To hide your stories:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Go to Settings > Privacy > Story.</li>
                            <li>Select Hide Story From and choose the users you want to exclude.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h2>Instagram Advanced Security</h2>
                        <p>Instagram privacy settings are a good starting point but there's a lot more when it comes to
                            protecting your account. It's crucial to set up strong security measures before anything
                            goes wrong.</p>

                        <p>Let‚Äôs talk about advanced security</p>


                        <h3>Step One: Enable Two-Factor Authentication</h3>
                        <p>This is one of the most effective strategies when it comes to protecting your account. By
                            enabling 2FA, whenever you try to login to your account, instagram will send a code to your
                            email or registered phone number to verify it's the same person logging in. It's like adding
                            an extra layer of security.</p>
                        <p class="more-storng">How to enable 2FA:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Go to Settings > Security > Two-Factor Authentication.</li>
                            <li>Choose between SMS or an authentication app.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h3>Step Two: Always Use Unique and Strong Passwords.</h3>
                        <p>Go the extra mile and use a completely different and strong password. Do not repeat the same
                            old passwords. Make it as difficult as it can be by adding a mix of small letters, capital
                            letters, symbols, numbers to make it stronger. And if you still cannot do this, use a
                            password manager if you cannot memorize your password.</p>
                        <h3>Step Three: Always Check Where You‚Äôre Logged In</h3>
                        <p>You can always check your login activity. If you feel something suspicious, spend a few
                            minutes to change your password as your account might be accessed by another person. Act
                            fast and do not linger on.</p>

                        <h2>How to Erase Your Digital Footprint</h2>
                        <p>Instagram keeps tabs on your every activity. Whether you just tapped that heart, wrote a
                            comment, scrolled through your feed, or spent extra time on specific content‚Äîeven your
                            searches‚Äîit records everything in its digital memory. And the stuff you delete? It‚Äôs still
                            there. So, you need to take a closer, deeper look at what can be done.</p>
                        <h3>Think Before You Post Anything</h3>

                        <p>What you share online is like a feather in the wind‚Äîyou no longer have any control over it.
                            Whatever you post or write in the comments, people can take a screenshot of it. Later, this
                            screenshot can be misused against you or taken out of context, which might affect your
                            reputation. And even if you delete any of your data, it might still be stored in Instagram‚Äôs
                            backups for some time.</p>
                        <p>The fix ? Be intentional. Always post with the future in mind. What you share today might
                            affect how people see you later in life.</p>

                        <h3>Turn Off Location When Not in Use</h3>
                        <p>When you share your location, you are actually inviting risks. A stranger might have been
                            stalking you for some time, and now you‚Äôre giving away your exact location, making it easier
                            for them to find you. If you publicly share your vacation pictures and tag your location,
                            your home might be at risk of burglary. Moreover, Instagram and third-party apps use this
                            data to show ads based on your preferences.</p>

                        <h2>Risks Involved with Third-Party Instagram Apps</h2>
                        <p>There are third-party apps out there which promise you to bring in a large number of
                            followers, likes and comments. They can schedule the posts for you and give you data
                            insights. Not all of them are risky, but some are. They can collect and misuse your personal
                            data.</p>

                        <h3>How these apps access your data:</h3>
                        <p>Once you give the app the right to connect to your account, you are actually giving them the
                            permission to do what they can about your personal information and data. Use only trusted
                            apps and know what data they collect. They can sell this information to advertisers.</p>

                        <h3>Give Permission to Trusted Apps Only</h3>
                        <p>Although no one ever takes the time out to read an app‚Äôs privacy policy. But you are advised
                            to read it in detail to know what data they collect and what they do about it. If it's
                            asking for a lot then you need to look into it before you allow them access.</p>

                        <h3>Some tips:</h3>
                        <ul class="less-strong">
                            <li>Use trusted apps only</li>

                        <h2>Don‚Äôt Just Delete Your Instagram ‚Äî Do This First</h2>
                        <p>If you‚Äôve made the decision to delete your Instagram account, it's important to back up your
                            data first.</p>
                        <p>Instagram has been collecting everything about you‚Äîfrom your very first post, like, and
                            comment to everything you've done up to this day. That‚Äôs a lot of data. But before you
                            delete your account, make sure to download it. You‚Äôll probably be shocked at how much
                            they‚Äôve tracked over the years.</p>
                        <p>Deleting social media for good is a bold move. But remember, once it‚Äôs gone, it‚Äôs gone
                            forever. You won‚Äôt be able to retrieve your posts, reels, or DMs.
                            If you just need a break from the platform, consider temporarily deactivating your account
                            instead.</p>
                        <p>Don‚Äôt act on impulse. If you‚Äôve truly decided to delete your account and have backed up your
                            data‚Äîthen go for it. But make that choice mindfully.
